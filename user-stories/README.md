# Airbnb Clone Backend User Stories

## Objective
This directory contains the documentation for Task 2 of the ALX Airbnb Clone project: converting the use case diagram from Task 1 into user stories. The user stories capture the core interactions between users `(Guest, Host, Admin)` and the Airbnb Clone backend system, focusing on key functionalities such as user registration, property booking, and administrative tasks.

## Files
- **README.md**: This file, describing the purpose and context of the user stories.
- **user-stories.md**: A Markdown file listing at least five user stories derived from the Task 1 use case diagram.

## User Stories Overview
The `user-stories.md` file contains five user stories derived from the use case diagram (`use-case-diagram/use-case-diagram.png`), capturing the core interactions between users (Guest, Host, Admin) and the Airbnb Clone backend system. Each user story follows the format: *`“As a [actor], I want to [action] so that [benefit].”`*

Core functionalities covered include:
- User registration and account management.
- Property search and listing management.
- Booking creation and management.
- Administrative oversight of platform operations.

### Actors
- **Guest**: A user who searches for, books, and reviews properties.
- **Host**: A user who creates and manages property listings and responds to bookings and reviews.
- **Admin**: A user who oversees users, listings, bookings, and payments.
